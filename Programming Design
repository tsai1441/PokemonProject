This file is the main file for the design of the project. This is used to demonstrate how to define classes, interfaces, variables
and methods in the java language
The foundation classes used in this projects are:
Pokemon
Player
PokemonFactory
PokemonStadium
PokemonClinic

The interfaces are:
PokemonInterfaceFire
PokemonInterfaceWater
PokemonInterfaceGrass

The above interfaces have their own methods defined but not implemented. They could also have variables predefined such as 
weakerOpponentType 
strongerOpponentTYpe
ex. for a Fire type pokemon the weakerOpponentType will be Grass while the strongerOpponentType will be Water
so when a fire type attack a grass type the effect is doubled and if a fire type attack a water ktype the effect is halfed.

We need to design the main screen
maybe a screen with game stat for the player

action:
  roll the wheel of fortune  
  repair damaged pokemon


Wheel of Fortune:
  numerous possible outcome of the wheels:
  such as:
  found a wild pokemon
  receive 10 poky balls
  ...
  
Rules:
The player starts the game with zero pokemon. 
The player is given one poke ball every time he roll the dice

Program flow:
